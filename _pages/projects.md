## Modelling vegetation uptake of atmospheric mercury
The terrestrial biosphere is a major sink of atmospheric mercury, but global estimates of this sink vary widely (1000–4000 tons per year). I am compiling available measurements of mercury vegetation uptake from the literature and comparing them to simulations in the global chemistry-transport model GEOS-Chem, in order to assess the magnitude of the mercury vegetation sink. I am also interested in how climate change and deforestation will affect biosphere-atmosphere exchange of mercury in the future.

## Biogeochemical selenium and sulfur cycles
Selenium and sulfur are both essential nutrients for humans and animals, and sulfur is additionally required by plants. Atmospheric deposition of these elements to agricultural soils is important for replenishing nutrients lost during crop harvest. However, deposition of sulfur and selenium has been decreasing in Europe and North America over recent decades due to reduced anthropogenic emissions. We ran simulations in a chemistry-climate model (SOCOL-AER) studying recent and future trends in sulfur and selenium deposition under two socioeconomic scenarios ([Feinberg et al., CEE, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-021-00172-0)). Across the Northern Hemisphere, deposition to agricultural soils will decline by 70–90% for sulfur and 55–80% for selenium by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. These deposition changes will shift the mass balance of sulfur and selenium in the surface environment, as already evidenced by declining streamwater loads in the Northeastern US. We have also linked declining atmospheric deposition in the Baltic Sea region to recent decreases in the selenium concentration of herring tissues ([Soerensen et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1039/d1em00418b)).

## Statistical techniques to assess and constrain model uncertainties
Atmospheric chemistry models contain many uncertain parameters, yet due to their computational complexity it has been difficult to explore their full uncertainty space. We conducted a global sensitivity analysis on the atmospheric selenium model (SOCOL-AER), considering the impact of 34 parameters (reaction rates, emissions, aerosol partitioning) on deposition maps and the overall atmospheric lifetime of selenium ([Feinberg et al., ACP, 2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-1363-2020)). The sensitivity analysis was facilitated by building a statistical emulator (surrogate model) in the form of polynomial chaos expansions to represent the output of the full SOCOL-AER model. Despite wide uncertainties in the atmospheric selenium reaction rate, we calculated that the mean atmospheric selenium lifetime is likely between 3 and 6 days, establishing that long range atmospheric transport (>1000 km) can occur. We also identified that uncertainties in selenium emissions are the main driver for uncertainties in deposition maps. This finding inspired our next study to constrain the emissions of selenium from different sources using Bayesian inference and a compiled database of atmospheric selenium observations from more than 600 measurement stations ([Feinberg et al., EST, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c01408)).
