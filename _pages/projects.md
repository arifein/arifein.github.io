### Modelling vegetation uptake of atmospheric mercury
The terrestrial biosphere is a major sink of atmospheric mercury, but global estimates of this sink vary widely (1000–4000 tons per year). I am compiling available measurements of mercury vegetation uptake from the literature and comparing them to simulations in the global chemistry-transport model GEOS-Chem, in order to assess the magnitude of the mercury vegetation sink. I am also interested in how climate change and deforestation will affect biosphere-atmosphere exchange of mercury in the future.

### Biogeochemical selenium and sulfur cycles
Selenium and sulfur are both essential nutrients for humans and animals, and sulfur is additionally required by plants. Atmospheric deposition of these elements to agricultural soils is important for replenishing nutrients lost during crop harvest. However, deposition of sulfur and selenium has been decreasing in Europe and North America over recent decades due to reduced anthropogenic emissions. We ran simulations in a chemistry-climate model (SOCOL-AER) studying recent and future trends in sulfur and selenium deposition under two socioeconomic scenarios ([Feinberg et al., CEE, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-021-00172-0)). Across the Northern Hemisphere, deposition to agricultural soils will decline by 70–90% for sulfur and 55–80% for selenium by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. These deposition changes will shift the mass balance of sulfur and selenium in the surface environment, as already evidenced by declining streamwater loads in the Northeastern US. We have also linked declining atmospheric deposition in the Baltic Sea region to recent decreases in the selenium concentration of herring tissues ([Soerensen et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1039/d1em00418b)).
