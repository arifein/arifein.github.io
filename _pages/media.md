## Wikipedia editing
Wikipedia is likely the first stop many people go (including general public, scientists, and students) to learn about a new topic. Inspired by a [Twitter exchange](https://x.com/markmccaughrean/status/1559687188568313857) about outdated information on the mercury Wikipedia page, I am working towards editing information on pages within my scientific expertise. The pages I found that need updates are: 

- [Mercury_(element)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element))
- [Mercury cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_cycle)
- [Selenium cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_cycle)

Contact me if you're interested in collaborating on this! I've found these resources helpful for starting my Wikipedia editing journey:
- [Help:Wikipedia editing for researchers, scholars, and academics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikipedia_editing_for_researchers,_scholars,_and_academics)
- [Three Reasons Why Earth Scientists Should Edit Wikipedia](https://eos.org/opinions/three-reasons-why-earth-scientists-should-edit-wikipedia)
