Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I work in the group of [Prof. Noelle Selin](http://www.selingroup.org), focusing on atmospheric mercury (Hg) modelling. I am interested in refining the global mercury budget using observational constraints and an array of data analysis tools â€” box models, chemistry-transport models (GEOS-Chem), and statistical models. 

Before joining MIT, I did my PhD (defended virtually in 2020) at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science (IAC) and the Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics (IBP) at ETH Zurich, where I was also affiliated with the aquatic research institute Eawag. My PhD project was about the biogeochemical cycles of sulfur and selenium: two elements with analogous chemical behaviour, but very different impacts on climate (for sulfur) and ecosystems and health (for both sulfur and selenium).

I hold a MSc in Atmospheric and Climate Science from ETH Zurich (2016), with my MSc thesis focused on modelling atmospheric methane isotopes. I graduated from McGill University in 2014 with a BSc (Honours) in Chemistry and a Minor in Mathematics.

Research interests
======
My research interests range broadly within atmospheric chemistry, biogeochemistry, climate, and sustainability. The environmental cycle of trace elements, many of which are important for human health, ecosystems, and/or climate, have been anthropogenically perturbed over the last several thousand years. Some of the impacts due to these changing trace element cycles are known (e.g., increasing sulfur emissions after the industrial revolution led to enhanced air pollution and climate cooling). However, for other elements and processes, the impacts are unknown or speculative (e.g., did increasing anthropogenic emissions of the essential element selenium affect human nutrition?). My research aims to quantify trends in trace elements in different environmental compartments and understand their impacts for ecosystems and health (see selenium publication in [Commun. Earth Environ.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-021-00172-0)).

I am particularly interested by applying data science techniques to environmental science problems, while maintaining strong collaborations with experimental and field scientists to better understand the data going into these models. I have applied several surrogate modelling techniques to better quantify uncertainties and parameter sensitivities in computationally complex models (see selenium publications in [ACP](https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-1363-2020) and [ES&T](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c01408)).
