Currently, I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellow 🇪🇺 in the [Blas Cabrera Institute of Physical Chemistry](https://www.iqf.csic.es/en/) (IQF), which is part of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). I work in the group of [Prof. Alfonso Saiz-Lopez](https://ac2.iqf.csic.es/en/), focusing on the atmospheric chemistry of the toxic pollutant mercury (Hg). I am interested in refining the global mercury budget using observational constraints and an array of data analysis tools — box models, chemistry-transport models, and statistical models. 

Before joining IQF-CSIC, I was a SNSF Early Postdoc.Mobility Fellow in the group of [Prof. Noelle Selin](https://selingroup.org) at MIT. There I began my foray into mercury modelling, including using GEOS-Chem to analyze the uptake of gaseous mercury by the terrestrial biosphere and recent trends in atmospheric mercury concentrations. 

I did my PhD (defended virtually in 2020) at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science (with [Prof. Thomas Peter](https://iac.ethz.ch/former-group/atmospheric-chemistry.html)) and the Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics at ETH Zurich (with [Prof. Lenny Winkel](https://ieg.ethz.ch/)), where I was also affiliated with the aquatic research institute Eawag. My PhD project was about the biogeochemical cycles of sulfur and selenium: two elements with analogous chemical behaviour and substantial impacts on ecosystems and health.

I hold a MSc in Atmospheric and Climate Science from ETH Zurich (2016), with my MSc thesis focused on modelling atmospheric methane isotopes. I graduated from McGill University in 2014 with a BSc (Honours) in Chemistry and a Minor in Mathematics.
