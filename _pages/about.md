Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I work in the group of [Prof. Noelle Selin](http://www.selingroup.org), focusing on atmospheric mercury (Hg) modelling. I am interested in refining the global mercury budget using observational constraints and an array of data analysis tools — box models, chemistry-transport models (GEOS-Chem), and statistical models. 

Before joining MIT, I did my PhD (defended virtually in 2020) at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science and the Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics at ETH Zurich, where I was also affiliated with the aquatic research institute Eawag. My PhD project was about the biogeochemical cycles of sulfur and selenium: two elements with analogous chemical behaviour and substantial impacts on climate (for sulfur), ecosystems, and health.

I hold a MSc in Atmospheric and Climate Science from ETH Zurich (2016), with my MSc thesis focused on modelling atmospheric methane isotopes. I graduated from McGill University in 2014 with a BSc (Honours) in Chemistry and a Minor in Mathematics.
